# Market_Segmentation_In_Insurance
Market segmentation is a marketing strategy used in every field, that uses well-defined criteria to divide a brand's total addressable market share into smaller groups. Each group, or segment, shares common characteristics that enable the brand to create focused and targeted products, offers and experiences. In this case we are given an insurance customer dataset for customer segmentation to give recommendations like saving plans, loans, wealth management, etc. on target customer groups.


# Data Description
The sample Dataset summarizes the usage behavior of thousands of active credit card holders during a 6 month span. The file is at a customer level with 18 behavioral variables.
